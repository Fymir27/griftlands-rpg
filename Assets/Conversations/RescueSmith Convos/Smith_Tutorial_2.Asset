  conversation:
  - Smith:Pretty strong, right? Smashing through rocks is the best. ALMOST as good
    as drinking!
  - Smith:Wait, maybe it counts cause I'm getting "smashed?"...huh. Whatever.
  - Rook:Yes, well good luck dealing with long-range foes.
  - Sal:Or dashing over gaps.
  - Smith:Hey, we all have our strengths. Mine is just actual physical strength.
    And maybe livers that won't give out.
  - "Smith:But fine, we can swap out with [ 1 ], [ 2 ], and [ 3 ] if there\u2019s
    something a hammer CAN\u2019T solve."
  - "Smith:Which I\u2019m sure will be rare."
