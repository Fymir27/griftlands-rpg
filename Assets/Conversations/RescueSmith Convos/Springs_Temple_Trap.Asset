  conversation:
  - :You think you're stepping carefully. You think you're being alert.
  - :...You think you just felt something catch on your boot, before a tremendous
    crash echoes in the passage behind you.
  - :You grimace and slowly turn around. Rook is apparently more concerned with giving
    you a look than he is with the carnage happening behind him.
  - :The shaking resides. A cloud of dust from the debris bursts from the passage,
    coating Rook head to toe.
  - :Rook's smirk remains. Your irritation finally wins out and you snarl, jabbing
    a finger at him.
  - Sal:Not. A. Word.
  - Sal:Wipe that stupid grin off your face and let's go find Smith.
  - :Rook does no such thing and follows you down the corridor.
