  conversation:
  - You think you're stepping carefully. You think you're being alert.
  - ...You think you feel something catch on your boot, before a tremendous crash
    echoes in the passage behind you.
  - You grimace and slowly turn around. Rook is apparently more concerned with smirking
    at you than he is with the carnage happening behind him.
  - The shaking subsides. A cloud of dust from the debris bursts from the passage,
    coating Rook head to toe.
  - Rook, unfazed, just continues smirking.
  - Your irritation wins out and you jab a finger at him.
  - Sal:Not.
  - Sal:A word.
  - Sal:Wipe that stupid grin off your face and let's go find Smith.
  - Rook does no such thing as he follows you down the corridor.
