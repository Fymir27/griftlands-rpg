  conversation:
  - :You round the corner and nearly bump into a large figure in tattered Rise clothing.
    As imposing as he is, he seems to recoil at the sight of Smith looming behind
    you.
  - Rise Rebel:Oh no, it's you.
  - Rise Rebel:Just leave me alone. I'm still sore from cleaning up your mess.
  - Sal:What mess? I thought we left it pretty clean back there.
  - Rook:You did collapse an entire-
  - Smith:I think they're talking about something I did, Sal.
  - Rise Rebel:Exactly. Your friend over there wasn't too happy that we tried to
    recruit him.
  - Smith:You promised me free booze! Who the Hesh would lie about having free booze?
  - Rook:The Rise, apparently.

  - Smith:What about me?
  - Rise Rebel:That was directed at all three of you. For the love of Hesh, just
    go away.
