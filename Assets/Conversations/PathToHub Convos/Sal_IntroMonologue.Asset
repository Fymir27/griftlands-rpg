  conversation:
  - "Sal:Ugh\u2026"
  - :You sit up to rub your aching head - and with the motion comes a flash of clarity
    that has you on your feet in an instant.
  - Sal:Rook and Smith, they're - they could be in danger!
  - :Not only that, the fact that you're alone has left you with a queasy feeling.
    It could be the stench of the bog, but you know better.
  - :You're just too afraid to admit it out loud.
  - Sal:I have to go find them.
  - :You already have a lead - tracks in the dirt, still fresh, following some trail
    you might've explored in your childhood.
  - :No time to reminisce, though.
