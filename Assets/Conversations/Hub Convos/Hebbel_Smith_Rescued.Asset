  conversation:
  - Hebbel doesn't look surprised when you come back this time. In fact, he looks
    cranky - even more so than usual.
  - Hebbel:Smith, before you ask, I am not having a sale. In fact, drinks are triple
    the price right now, and it only applies to you.
  - Smith:Well that's not a nice way to greet a pal you haven't seen in a while!
  - Hebbel:We are not 'pals'. Not after the thousands of shills in property damage
    you caused my bar
  - You can't find the words to say, but you can easily imagine the chaos that Hebbel
    is speaking of.
  - It's gloriously terrifying.
  - "Despite Hebbel\u2019s prickly demeanor, you swear you see the hint of a smile
    on his face as he turns and busies himself with another order of drinks."
  - Hebbel:You three haven't even been in here for five minutes and I'm already sick
    of your faces.
  - Hebbel:Whatever you need, make it quick.
