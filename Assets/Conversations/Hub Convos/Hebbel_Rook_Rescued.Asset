  conversation:
  - "Hebbel:You actually got Rook back in one piece?"
  - "Sal:You actually doubted my abilities?"
  - ":Hebbel doesn't say anything, but you can see the astonishment on his face, clear
    as day."
  - "Rook:It's a pleasure to see you again, Hebbel. Are the bog mites still keeping
    you company?"
  - "Hebbel:Just take whatever supplies you two need and go find your other friend.
    I'm too tired for this crap."
  - ":Hebbel rolls his eyes and picks up another chipped glass to polish, leaving
    you with a final piece of advice."
  - "Hebbel:Last I saw, a group of figures were taking Smith south of here - likely
    towards some of the old ruins in the Bog."
  - "Hebbel:I'd bet a few shills they were members of the Rise, so keep your wits
    about you."
