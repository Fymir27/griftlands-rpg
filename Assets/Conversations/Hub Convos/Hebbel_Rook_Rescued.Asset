  conversation:
  - Hebbel:You actually got Rook back in one piece?
  - Sal:You actually doubted my abilities?
  - Hebbel doesn't say anything, but you can see the astonishment on his face, clear
    as day.
  - Rook:It's a pleasure to see you again, Hebbel. Are the bog mites still keeping
    you company?
  - Hebbel:Just take whatever supplies you two need and go find your other friend.
    I'm too tired for this crap.
  - Hebbel snorts and picks up another chipped glass to polish, leaving you with
    a final piece of advice.
  - Hebbel:Last I saw, a group of figures was taking Smith south of here - likely
    towards some of the old ruins in the Bog.
  - Hebbel:I'd bet a few shills they were members of the Rise, so keep your wits
    about you.
