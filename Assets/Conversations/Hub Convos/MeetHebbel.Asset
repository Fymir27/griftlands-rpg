  conversation:
  - Sal:Barkeep! Have you seen-
  - Hebbel:A guy with a mustache and a kra'deshi about yea high?
  - Sal:...How did you-
  - "Hebbel:There was some commotion happening outside earlier. Those two grifters,
    they got into trouble with the Spark Barons and The Rise\u2026"
  - Hebbel:You know them?
  - Sal:They're my friends, yes! Where were they taken?
  - :The barkeep pulls a worn paper map from under the bar, makes some broad strokes
    on it with a pen, then hands the paper to you.
  - Hebbel:I only saw where they got taken. You're on your own for the rest.
  - :He points to a messy, tangled section of bog east of you on the map.
  - Hebbel:Spark Barons had a worn-down shack of an outpost there at one point, so
    I'm assuming they were the ones carting Rook off in such a hurry.
  - Hebbel:Just keep an eye out for any...unsavory creatures out that way.
  - Sal:Wait, you're gonna help me? Just like that?
  - Hebbel:It's a small world, grifter. I happen to know your two friends, and that
    if anything were to happen to them I'd have Hesh and high water coming down on
    me.
  - "Sal:Thank you, Mister\u2026?"
  - Hebbel:Call me Hebbel. Come back here if you need anything.
