  conversation:
  - Rook sweeps up the second device, gives it a once-over, and sticks it in a pocket
    somewhere in his uniform.
  - Sal:How many pockets do you have in there, exactly?
  - "Rook:Enough to keep me stocked in the ammo department, but that\u2019s not important.

  - "Sal:That\u2019s right, I did...What do you think it means?"
  - "Rook:I don\u2019t know. Whatever it is, I don\u2019t like it."
  - Rook:Let's keep going. Bound to be another path that will take us back to the
