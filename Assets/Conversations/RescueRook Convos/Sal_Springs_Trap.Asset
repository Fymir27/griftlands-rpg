  conversation:
  - :You think you notice something...off about the passage in front of you. But
    then again, what in the Grout Bog isn't?
  - "Sal:Now *that* doesn't seem suspicious\u2026"
  - :You know squinting at every weird lump in your path would take all day, and
    time is of the essence. Your concern for Rook propels you forward.
  - ":...You hear a click as you pass. You\u2019d be kicking yourself if it weren\u2019t
    immediately followed by an explosion and the sound of rocks, trees, and bog peat
    collapsing behind you."
  - Sal:Ugh.
  - :You dust yourself off, unscathed - though it appears the path back has become
    an impassable, swampy crater.
  - Sal:...Well. Nowhere to go but forward, I guess.
  - :At least no one will know it was you.
