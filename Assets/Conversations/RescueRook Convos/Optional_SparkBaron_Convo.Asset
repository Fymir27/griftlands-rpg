  conversation:
  - :You see a particularly threadbare and exhausted Spark Baron huddled out of sight
    of the bog creatures lurking about..
  - Spark Baron:Ah, it's you.
  - Spark Baron:Listen, as long as you don't tell my boss I'm here, I won't hold
    anything against you. I just want to keep my terrible job.
  - "Spark Baron:I don't get paid enough for this oshnudung\u2026"
  - Sal:Mind explaining what exactly happened back there?
  - "Spark Baron:Rook's wanted for his actions against the Spark Barons. Also, I
    think his mustache\u2019s ugly."
  - :The look on Rook's face is either insulted or entirely too pleased with himself.
  - Spark Baron:Oh yeah, the regional manager wanted to speak to him. Something about
    'catching up with his old friend' or whatever.
  - Rook:I think I'll pass.
  - Spark Baron:And you will, but leave me alone now before I decide that you won't.
