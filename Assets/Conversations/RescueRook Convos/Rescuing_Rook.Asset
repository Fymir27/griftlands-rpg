  conversation:
  - Sal:Rook! Not sure where the Barons are, but we gotta move.
  - ":You approach Rook\u2019s cell and use a dagger to pop open the rusted door
    with relative ease."
  - Sal:Are you okay? They didn't hurt you, did they-
  - :Rook flashes you a sly grin as he slips from the cell and retrieves his guns
    from the corner.
  - Rook:Nice going, kid. Did you singe your eyebrows off when you tripped that mine
    back there?
  - Sal:I - haha, what? I didn't trip any mines-
  - Rook:Counted six of them as they dragged me in. I have no doubt in your keenness,
    of course - but I knew that you would step on at least one.
  - Sal:Your faith in me is astounding as always, I see.
  - Rook:Also, I heard the cacophonous explosion from here.
  - Sal:S i g h .
